# Timer 24H v1.1.0-beta.2 🧪

## 🎛️ New Feature: Enable/Disable Timer Switch

This beta release adds a powerful new optional feature - the ability to enable or disable the timer without changing your schedule!

### ✨ What's New

**Enable/Disable Toggle Switch**
- Add an optional toggle switch to your card to enable/disable the timer
- When disabled, the timer keeps tracking time but won't control your entities
- Perfect for temporary overrides without losing your schedule
- State persists across Home Assistant restarts
- Available in Hebrew and English

### 🎯 How to Use

#### In Your Card
Add this to your Lovelace card configuration:

```yaml
type: custom:timer-24h-card
entity: sensor.your_timer
show_enable_switch: true  # Show the toggle switch
```

#### In Automations
Use the new service to control the timer programmatically:

```yaml
service: timer_24h.set_enabled
data:
  entity_id: sensor.your_timer
  enabled: false  # Disable timer (or true to enable)
```

**Example Use Cases:**
- Disable timer when on vacation
- Override timer during special occasions
- Integrate with presence detection
- Create "override" buttons in your dashboard
